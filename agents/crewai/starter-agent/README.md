## Setup

The code can be run locally or on Google colab.  Colab is recommended, as it doesn't need any setup.

### Local env setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone   https://github.com/nebius/ai-studio-cookbook/
cd  agents/crewai/starter-agent
```
2. Install dependencies:

Using conda/pip

```bash
pip  install  -r requirements.txt
```

if using `uv` package manager
```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Nebius API key:

```
NEBIUS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
