## TLDR;

- **Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507** (released July 2025) supercedes the previous **Qwen3-235B-A22B** (released Apr 2025) model
- This update has two variants: thinking and instruct.  (Previous model Qwen3-235B-A22B was a hybrid thinking model)
  - [Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507) - thinking model
  - [Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507) - instruct model
- From Qwen team ([source](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7353110351388819457/))
  - "After talking with the community and thinking it through, we decided to stop using hybrid thinking mode. Instead, we‚Äôll train Instruct and Thinking models separately so we can get the best quality possible" 
   - "A small update on Qwen3-235B-A22B, but a big improvement on its quality!"
- 235B total params / 22B activated (Mixture of Experts architecture)
- Native 262K context window
- Strong performances in math, logic, and coding 
- Outperforms Kimi K2 (1T params) and Claude Opus 4 (Non-Thinking) on several key benchmarks
- Run it on [Nebius AI Studio](https://studio.nebius.com/playground?models=Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507)

## Performance and Benchmarks

### Official benchmark

### Artificial Analysis 

Here we see Qwen3 model is the top performing open source model.  And its pretty close to state of the art proprietary models!

### Fun 'Vibe' Benchmark ü™ø üö≤

My favorite 'vibe benchmark' is "Pelican riding a bicycle" üòÄ

This is inpired by [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/)'s experiment called [pelican riding a bicycle](https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/).

You can see [our pelican experiments here](../fun/pelican-riding-bicycle/)

So how does the update do on 'pelican benchmark'?  See for yourself!
